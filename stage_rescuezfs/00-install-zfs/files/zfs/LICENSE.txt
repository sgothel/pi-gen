ZFS On Linux parts: 'zfs-linux-x.y.z-*'

The majority of the code in the ZFS on Linux port comes from OpenSolaris
which has been released under the terms of the CDDL open source license.
This includes the core ZFS code, libavl, libnvpair, libefi, libunicode,
and libutil.  The original OpenSolaris source can be downloaded from:

http://dlc.sun.com/osol/on/downloads/b121/on-src.tar.bz2

Files which do not originate from OpenSolaris are noted in the file header
and attributed properly.  These exceptions include, but are not limited
to, the vdev_disk.c and zvol.c implementation which are licensed under
the CDDL.

The zpios test code is originally derived from the Lustre pios test code
which is licensed under the GPLv2.  As such the heavily modified zpios
kernel test code also remains licensed under the GPLv2.

The latest stable and development versions of this port can be downloaded
from the official ZFS on Linux site located at:

http://zfsonlinux.org/

This ZFS on Linux port was produced at the Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory (LLNL) under Contract No. DE-AC52-07NA27344 (Contract 44)
between the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and Lawrence Livermore
National Security, LLC (LLNS) for the operation of LLNL.  It has been
approved for release under LLNL-CODE-403049.

Unless otherwise noted, all files in this distribution are released
under the Common Development and Distribution License (CDDL).
Exceptions are noted within the associated source files.  See the file
OPENSOLARIS.LICENSE for more information.
